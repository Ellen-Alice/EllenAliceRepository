# Welcome to my repository ðŸŒ¹
I discovered my passion for application development and software engineering through my recent work experiences, and I am now halfway through a year-long course in the WoTech program, where I am acquiring skills in Java, Python, SQLite, and data analysis.

My background includes over ten years of experience in culture, marketing, and project management, and I am eager to gain practical experience in the IT industry.

# year 2025

Here, I document my journey in three exciting areas of technology and education.
